## Purpose

A barebones Reddit clone that allows user to create posts in categories,
comment on the posts, and upvote / downvote posts and categories.

## Setup

The front-end application **assumes** there is a server back-end running on port
`3001`. To change this configuration, please take a look at the `proxy` property
of the `package.json` file.

After starting your back-end project, run `yarn start`.
